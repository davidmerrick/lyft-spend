## Running locally

This project was bootstrapped with [create react app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To run it locally, first get a Lyft API key from [here](https://www.lyft.com/developers).
Clone the repo.
Run `yarn install` to install dependencies.
Create a `.envrc` file, and set the `REACT_APP_LYFT_CLIENT_ID` and `REACT_APP_LYFT_CLIENT_SECRET` to the ones you got from Lyft.
Run `yarn start` to start the webapp. A browser should automatically load the page.
